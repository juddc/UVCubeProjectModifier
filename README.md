# UVCubeProjectModifier
A Blender addon that sets up UV cube projection as a modifier so that you can have reasonable looking UVs applied
after other modifiers that stretch or distort your UVs.

This addon is not intended to give perfect results every time, but simply to give reasonable results for rapid prototyping.

This is a very mimimal addon, as it just applys a built-in modifier and sets it up for you. As such, it has no UI.
To use it, just select the object you want to apply it to, hit space, and type in `uv cube`. "Add UV Cube Projection Modifier" should appear in the list.
Click it, and the modifier is applied.
